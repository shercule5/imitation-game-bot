# Imitation Game Bot ðŸŽ®ðŸ¤–  This project recreates Alan Turingâ€™s *Imitation Game* (also known as the Turing Test) in a Discord environment.   The game allows one **Interrogator**, one **Human contestant**, and one **AI contestant** to interact.   The Interrogator asks questions and then guesses which contestant is the AI.
